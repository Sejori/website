# Nicely Done!

You built my house and left my window open because you were looking for secrets. Well let me tell you one: I struggle in under-stimulating and overly-structured environments. But don't we all?

Many people expericence ADHD symptoms such as low attention span and mood swings and the diagnosis of it has become a lot more common. This is likely due to environmental factors of modern life such as poor diet, pollution, plastics, technology, distractions and who knows what else.

The best description I've heard of ADHD is that it is the result of low baseline dopamine in the brain. This leads to impulsive, dopamine-seeking behaviour and can result in manic moods, irregular stress levels and addictions if not managed carefully. Anyone with ADHD can probably relate to at least one of those symptoms. Managing relationships can be tricky too and sticking to a normal routine or schedule can feel impossible.

The trick to managing ADHD, in my non-medically-justified opinion, is to be aware of your dopamine sources and mindful of when you are in a dopamine-seeking state. We develop dopamine-releasing pathways in our brains throughout our lives but mostly in childhood. These form through association of one thing to another. For example, if people laughed when you told a joke you would have released dopamine, social validation is an instinctive dopamine-source - we need friends! This then helps make that joke-telling neural pathway in your brain release dopamine in the future.

Someone with ADHD might then run around telling everyone they know that joke because their brain has found a source of dopamine and using it helps relieve them of their dopamine-deprived state. Eventually this would become annoying for eveyone else but the child doesn't know how or when to stop. You might be able to picture a child you know doing this, this is quite normal behaviour for a young child after all.

The point is that dopamine-releasing behaviour is often good but ADHD sufferers can easily get caught in chasing it. Hence addiction being common. I personally find the dopamine release of close relationships to be difficult to manage and as you can imagine, this has caused many problems for me in the past.

Taking the time to understand what your dopamine-release mechanisms are and staying aware of yourself when using them is therefore key to managing ADHD. If you can identify when you are leaning into dopamine-seeking behaviour, then use a higher level of consciousness to decide if this behaviour is appropriate, you can turn your ADHD into a superpower!

I am realeasing lots of dopamine as I write this and I would say this is healthy behaviour but it could be described as a bit obsessive, I'm not being paid to write this but I am proud of what I am making. Many people who change the world are neurodivergent in one way or another and ADHD can be a highly motivating and creative disorder. It is a gift! But as the wise Ben Parker once said: With great power, comes great responsiblity.

If you identify with what I have written here then I seriously encourage you to read about the management of ADHD. Don't let your dopamine-pathways control you, take control of them! It's not easy but it is essential.
