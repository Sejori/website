# Serverless Edge Boosted (SEB)-stack

Yes... I've named a stack after myself.

**Serverless:** deploying static code into a runtime isolate on cloud (server but not persistent)

**Edge:** cached code assets on global infrastructure of content delivery network (CDN)

**Boosted:** WebAssembly for wider toolset and direct memory management (safe with Rust)

This setup takes so much of the headache out of app hosting. A drawback however is that adhering to data protection law means not storing user data outside of country of origin. So a degree of hosting is always eventually required, for good reason I suppose.

Luckily we have subnets on Deno Deploy that solve this. But I'm yet to explore them.
