        All technophiles welcome! ðŸ¤–
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here's a breakdown of the technologies we use everyday that I love so dearly:
      </p>
      <h2 id="operating-systems">
        Operating Systems
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://windows.com"><img class="icon" src="/icons/windows.svg" alt="windows"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/macos/"><img class="icon" src="/icons/macos.svg" alt="macos"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://android.com"><img class="icon" src="/icons/android.svg" alt="android"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix"><img class="icon" src="/icons/linux.svg" alt="linux"></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the beginning the lord made electricty. Then logic gates, capicitors and transistors, then... let there be light!
      </p>
      <p>
        Often overlooked by those that love to code but code needs somewhere to run free. Operating systems expose electrical hardware to applications via simpler programming languages such as C# so they don't need to be written in machine code.
      </p>
      <p>
         They started out as digital text editors with basic memory and evolved into the full-spec graphical user interfaces we know and love today. New frontiers like VR push the boundaries of how we engage with computers more and more but screen or holograms, we'll always need operating systems.
      </p>
      <h2 id="web-browsers">
        Web Browsers
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chromium.org"><img class="icon" src="/icons/chromium.svg" alt="chromium"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"><img class="icon" src="/icons/firefox.svg" alt="firefox"></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Web browsers are arguably the most important piece of software on any operating system. They turn your lonely computer into an inter-connected machine with the collective knowledge and tools of humanity at your fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
        They're packed full of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">great features</a> for web developers to play with and provide all the amazing gizmos needed to run websites and communicate to the outside world, such as: Code Interpretation, Graphical Rendering Engines, Network Code and Encryption Tools for secure communications between your website, your friends website and every other website in all the land.
      </p>
      <h2 id="html-css-js">
        HTML, CSS & JavaScript
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML5"><img class="icon" src="/icons/html5.svg" alt="html5"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS"><h2 class="icon">CSS</h2></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript"><img class="icon" src="/icons/javascript.svg" alt="javascript"></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        The dream team. These 3 technologies are the heart and soul of every website and have fascinated me since I first explored the internet as a child. Think of HTML as the skeleton, JavaScript as the muscles and CSS as the skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        For examples of HTML, CSS & JavaScript you need look no further than this very website.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          <strong>Remix on Glitch:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="glitchButton"></div>
      </div>
      <script src="https://button.glitch.me/button.js" defer></script>
      <h2 id="js-extended">
        The Extended Javascript Universe
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><h2 class="icon">Node.js</h2></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        From humble beginnings as a DOM manipulator (Document Object Model - it's how the browser interprets HTML & CSS) to working with files and data on machines and microcontrollers. JavaScript has worked it's way into all areas of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facebook's React library links your dynamic JavaScript variables to the DOM via it's "state" variables, a huge boost for people coding web application. It's spinoff cousin React-Native brings the same system to mobile application development and Electron brings web applications to desktop by utlising Google's open-source Chromium engine - awesome!
      </p>
      <p>
        How does JavaScript move beyond frontend user applications? Node.js (or it's successor Deno), that's how. A powerful engine for running Javascript outside of web browsers, with additional functionality for executing UNIX commands and working with files. It's wildly popular and drives the vast majority of open-source code around today.
      </p>
      <h2 id="c++">
        C++
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://isocpp.org"><img class="icon" src="/icons/c++.svg" alt="c++"></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Kickstarter of the age of information. C++ is everywhere. Your operating system? C++. Your plane's operating system? C++. The browser in which you are currently viewing this website? C. +. +. Created for ultimate flexibility by a hilariously nerdy-looking Swedish genius. There's nothing this language can't do. It might just require a million lines of code to get there...
      </p>
      <p>
        My relationship with C++ began at university, we met in the midst of confusing times. I was a 1st year BEng Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom and was quickly realising that my course was going to involve a lot of complex analytical methods (good ol' pen, paper & a calculator engineering). Being the nerd I am I was delighted to see a computing module on my timetable. Sure enough, it was love at first sight. It was in those classes that I began to consider a career in programming and I never looked back.  
      </p>
      <p>
        hint: a common exercise when learning about numerical methods in C++ is to write a cubic combination puzzle solver. I only got as far as the white cross before I got distracted writing web games...
