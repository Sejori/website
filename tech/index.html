        Here's a breakdown of the technologies we use everyday that I love so dearly:
      </p>
      <h2 id="operating-systems">
        Operating Systems
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://windows.com"><img class="icon" src="/icons/windows.svg" alt="windows"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/macos/"><img class="icon" src="/icons/macos.svg" alt="macos"></a>

        In the beginning the lord made electricty. Then capicitors, logic gates and transistors... let there be light!
      </p>
      <p>
        Often overlooked by those that love to code but of course our code needs somewhere to run free. Operating systems expose electrical <i>hard</i>ware to programmable <i>soft</i>ware via their amazing <i>firm</i>ware. This is so developers don't need to write yucky <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">binary</a> machine code and can instead build applications with more readable programming languages such as <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         They started out as digital text editors with basic memory and evolved into the full-spec graphical user interfaces we know and love today. New frontiers like VR push the boundaries of how we engage with computers but whether it's a screen or a hologram, we'll always need operating systems.
      </p>
      <h2 id="web-browsers">
        Web Browsers
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chromium.org"><img class="icon" src="/icons/chromium.svg" alt="chromium"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"><img class="icon" src="/icons/firefox.svg" alt="firefox"></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Web browsers are arguably the most important piece of software installed on any operating system. They turn your lonely computer into an internet-connected machine with the collective knowledge and tools of humanity at your fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
        They're packed full of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">great features</a> for web developers to play with and provide all the amazing gizmos needed to run websites and communicate to the outside world, such as: Code Interpretation, Graphical Rendering Engines, Network Code and Encryption Tools for secure communications between your website, your friends website and every other website in all the land.
      </p>
      <h2 id="html-css-js">
        HTML, CSS & JavaScript
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML5"><img class="icon" src="/icons/html5.svg" alt="html5"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS"><img class="icon" src="/icons/css.svg" alt="css"></a>

      <p>
        The dream team. These 3 technologies are the heart and soul of every website and have fascinated me since I first explored the internet as a child. Think of HTML as the skeleton, JavaScript as the muscles and CSS as the skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        For examples of HTML, CSS & JavaScript you need look no further than this very website.
      </p>
      <h2 id="js-extended">
        The Extended Javascript Universe
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <h2 class="royalblue"><a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> & <a target="_blank" href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a></h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        From humble beginnings as a DOM manipulator (DOM = Document Object Model - it's how a browser models a web page) to working with files and data on machines and microcontrollers. JavaScript has worked it's way into all areas of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facebook's <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">React library</a> links JavaScript variables to the DOM via "state" variables. It uses server-side JavaScript to generate optimised files for web pages and server-side render web content (SSR is a deeper concept - you'll have to get in touch with me personally if you want to find out more). Changes in state are first calculated in a Virtual DOM (VDOM) then efficiently mapped to the DOM via a process called VDOM-diffing. The React library resulted in a huge productivity boost for frontend web developers and has therefore exploded in popularity. It's spinoff cousin <a target="_blank" href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> brings the same system to mobile application development and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> brings web applications to desktop by utlising Google's open-source Chromium engine - awesome!
      </p>
      <p>
        How does JavaScript move beyond frontend user applications? Node.js (made with C++) or it's successor Deno (made with Rust), that's how. Both powerful engines for running Javascript outside of web browsers, with additional functionality for executing UNIX commands and working with files. NodeJS is wildly popular and drives the vast majority of open-source code today!
      </p>
      <h2 id="c++">
        The Low-Level Powerhouses: C++ & Rust
      </h2>
      <div class="row justify-center">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://isocpp.org"><img class="icon" src="/icons/c++.svg" alt="c++"></a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><img class="icon" src="/icons/rust.svg" alt="rust"></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Kickstarter of the age of information. C++ is everywhere. Your operating system? C++. Your plane's operating system? C++. The browser in which you are currently viewing this website? C. +. +. Created for ultimate flexibility by the hilariously quintessentially-nerdy Swedish genius, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>. There's nothing this language can't do. It might just require a million lines of code to get there...
      </p>
      <p>
        My relationship with C++ began at university, we met in the midst of confusing times. I was a 1st year BEng Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom and was quickly realising that my course was going to involve a lot of complex analytical methods (good ol' pen, paper & a calculator engineering). Being the nerd I am I was delighted to see a computing module on my timetable. Sure enough, it was love at first sight. It was in those classes that I began to consider a career in programming and I never looked back.  
      </p>
      <p>
        hint: a common exercise when learning about numerical methods in C++ is to write a cubic combination puzzle solver. I only got as far as <i>The White Cross</i> before I got distracted writing web games...
